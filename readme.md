# Friction and the City website

![](https://github.com/olliepalmer/frictionandthecity.com/raw/master/screenshot.png)

This is a simple one-page website for the University of Chicago's Friction and the City conference 2017. It's based on a template from [tutorialzine.com](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/freebie-landing-page-template-with-flexbox), with a few layout changes and some CSS, most notably angled text.

The conference website is now archived [here](https://frictionandthecity.netlify.com).

Feel free to take and modify this template as you see fit. I'd recommend changing the colours and line pattern in the top image.

There's a [blank template](https://github.com/olliepalmer/frictionandthecity.com/blob/master/index-blank.html) that you can edit to put your details into.
